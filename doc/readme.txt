1. Introduction
----------------
The Doxygen documentation is a comprehensive guide to understanding the code, including class definitions, functions, file structures, and relationships between components. It is auto-generated from annotated source code and offers both textual and graphical representations.



2. How to Start the Website

To view the documentation, follow these steps:

1. Open the folder containing the generated HTML files.
2. Locate the file named `index.html`.
3. Double-click on `index.html` to open it in your default web browser.

Alternatively, you can manually open it in a browser:
- Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open With" > Your Browser.

Note: Ensure all associated HTML, CSS, and JS files generated by Doxygen are in the same directory as `index.html`.

3. Additional Notes
--------------------
- The documentation is intended for developers and contributors to the project.
- To regenerate the documentation:
  - Ensure Doxygen is installed.
  - Update the Doxygen configuration file (`Doxyfile`) as needed.
